# TrackletEmulation
Updated 11/10/2017: now separates cluster-finding into two layers to more accurately emulate the firmware.
L1_cluster does phi-clustering in each etabin, and L2_cluster stitches everything together.

11/21/2017: updated to use an algorithm closer to the firmware algorithm. Also some bug fixes.

11/22/2017: fixed bug with counting number of tracks
